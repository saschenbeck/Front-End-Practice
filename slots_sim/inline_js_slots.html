        /*include a wild card function to allow the inclusion of a wild symbol
        current thoughts are to make a splice function that would take the results
         of the spin function, provide a random number to indicate how many wilds to appear,
         provide a random number to indicate in what array index the wild should be placed.
         A more advanced feature would be to establish a function that could regulate how often wilds
         could appear. This will also allow me to establish how often the other functions could occur
         and allow me to assign a point multiplier once a point system is established to calculate winnings.*/
